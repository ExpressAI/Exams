{'context': 'For Western designers, China and its rich culture have long been an inspiration for Western creative.\n\n"It\'s no secret that China has always been a source of inspiration for designers," says Amanda Hill, chief creative officer at A+E Networks, a global media company and home to some of the biggest fashion shows.\n\nEarlier this year, the China Through A Looking Glass exhibition in New York exhibited 140 pieces of China-inspired fashionable clothing alongside Chinese works of art, with the aim of exploring the influence of Chinese aesthetics on Western fashion and how China has fueled the fashionable imagination for centuries.
