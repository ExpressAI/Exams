        "context": "My Favourite Books\n\nJo Usmar is a writer for Cosmopolitan and co-author of the This Book Will series（系列）of lifestyle books. Here she picks her top reads.\n\nMatilda\n\nRoald Dahl\nI once wrote a paper on the influence of fairy tales on Roald Dahl's writing and it gave me a new appreciation for his strange and delightful words. Matilda's battles with her cruel parents and the bossy headmistress, Miss Trunchbull，are equally fumy and frightening, but they're also aspirational.\n\nAfter Dark\n\nHaruki Murakami\n\nIt’s about two sisters — Eri, a model who either won’t or can’t stop sleeping, and Mari, a young student. In trying to connect to her sister, Mari starts changing her life and discovers a world of diverse \"night people\" who are hiding secrets.\n\nGone Girl\n\nGillian Flynn\n\nThere was a bit of me that didn't want to love this when everyone else on the planet did, but the horror story is brilliant. There's tension and anxiety from the beginning as Nick and Amy battle for your trust. It's a real whodunit and the frustration when you realise what's going on is horribly enjoyable.\n\nThe Stand\n\nStephen King\n\nThis is an excellent fantasy novel from one of the best storytellers around. After a serious flu outbreak wipes out 99.4% of the world's population, a battle unfolds between good and evil among those left. Randall Flagg is one of the scariest characters ever.",

        "context": "\"You can use me as a last resort（选择）, and if nobody else volunteers, then I will do it.\" This was an actual reply from a parent after I put out a request for volunteers for my kids' lacrosse（长曲棍球）club.\n\nI guess that there's probably some demanding work schedule, or social anxiety around stepping up to help for an unknown sport. She may just need a little persuading. So I try again and tug at the heartstrings. I mention the single parent with four kids running the show and I talk about the dad coaching a team that his kids aren’t even on… At this point the unwilling parent speaks up, \"Alright. Yes, I’ll do it.\"\n\nI’m secretly relieved because I know there’s real power in sharing volunteer responsibilities among many. The unwilling parent organizes the meal schedule, sends out emails, and collects money for end-of-season gifts. Somewhere along the way, the same parent ends up becoming an invaluable member of the team. The coach is able to focus on the kids while the other parents are relieved to be off the hook for another season. Handing out sliced oranges to bloodthirsty kids can be as exciting as watching your own kid score a goal.\n\nStill, most of us volunteers breathe a sigh of relief when the season comes to a close. That relief is coupled with a deep understanding of why the same people keep coming back for more: Connecting to the community（社区）as you freely give your time, money, skills, or services provides a real joy. Volunteering just feels so good.\n\nIn that sense, I’m pretty sure volunteering is more of a selfish act than I’d freely like to admit. However, if others benefit in the process, and I get some reward too, does it really matter where my motivation lies?",

Lunch is Bechtel’s \"me\" time. And like more Americans, she’s not alone.\n\nA new report found 46 percent of meals are eaten alone in America. More than half（53 percent）have breakfast alone and nearly half（46 percent）have lunch by themselves. Only at dinnertime are we eating together anymore, 74 percent, according to statistics from the report.\n\n\"I prefer to go out and be out. Alone, but together, you know?\" Bechtel said, looking up from her book. Bechtel, who works in downtown West Palm Beach, has lunch with coworkers sometimes, but like many of us, too often works through lunch at her desk. A lunchtime escape allows her to keep a boss from tapping her on the shoulder. She returns to work feeling energized. \"Today, I just wanted some time to myself,\" she said.\n\nJust two seats over, Andrew Mazoleny, a local videographer, is finishing his lunch at the bar. He likes that he can sit and check his phone in peace or chat up the barkeeper with whom he's on a first-name basis if he wants to have a little interaction（交流）. \"I reflect on how my day's gone and think about the rest of the week,\" he said. \"It's a chance for self-reflection, You return to work recharged and with a plan.\"That freedom to choose is one reason more people like to eat alone. There was a time when people may have felt awkward about asking for a table for one, but those days are over. Now, we have our smartphones to keep us company at the table. \"It doesn't feel as alone as it may have before all the advances in technology,\" said Laurie Demeritt, whose company provided the statistics for the report.",

The microorganisms（微生物） from our bodies grow uncontrollably on surfaces of the International Space Station, so astronauts spend hours cleaning them up each week. How is NASA overcoming this very tiny big problem? It’s turning to a bunch of high school kids. But not just any kids. It depending on NASA HUNCH high school classrooms, like the one science teachers Gene Gordon and Donna Himmelberg lead at Fairport High School in Fairport, New York.\n\nHUNCH is designed to connect high school classrooms with NASA engineers. For the past two years, Gordon’s students have been studying ways to kill bacteria in zero gravity, and they think they’re close to a solution（解决方案）.\"We don’t give the students any breaks. They have to do it just like NASA engineers,\"says Florence Gold, a project manager.\n\n\"There are no tests,\" Gordon says. \"There is no graded homework. There almost are no grades, other than 'Are you working towards your goal?' Basically, it’s 'I’ve got to produce this product and then, at the end of year, present it to NASA.' Engineers come and really do an in-person review, and... it’s not a very nice thing at times. It’s a hard business review of your product.\"\n\nGordon says the HUNCH program has an impact（影响） on college admissions and practical life skills. \"These kids are so absorbed in their studies that I just sit back. I don’t teach.\" And that annoying bacteria? Gordon says his students are emailing daily with NASA engineers about the problem, readying a workable solution to test in space.",

Motivation and goal setting are the two sides of the same coin.<36>Like the child on the diving board, you will stay undecided.\n\n<37> More than that, how should you stay motivated to achieve the goal? First, you need to evaluate yourself, your values your strengths, your weaknesses, your achievements, your desires, etc. Only then should you set your goals.\n\nYou also need to judge the quality and depth of your motivation. This is quite important, because it is directly related to your commitment. There are times when your heart is not in your work. <38> So, slow down and think what you really want to do at that moment. Clarity（清晰）of thoughts can help you move forward.\n\nAnother way of setting realistic goals is to analyze your short and long term objectives, keeping in mind your beliefs, values and strengths. Remember that goals are flexible.  <39>  They also need to be measurable. You must keep these points in mind while setting your goals.\n\nYour personal circumstances are equally important. For example, you may want to be a Pilot but can’t become one because your eyesight is not good enough.  <40> You should reassess your goals, and motivate yourself to set a fresh goal.\n\nYou will surely need to overcome some difficulties, some planned, but most unplanned. You cannot overcome them without ample motivation. Make sure that you plan for these difficulties at the time of setting your goals.",
