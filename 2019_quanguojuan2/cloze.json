After a long and careful <47> , Greg saw, across a field, the dog moving <48> away. Ehlers eventually succeeded in coaxing the animal to him. Nervousness and fear were replaced with  <49>. It just started licking（舔）Ehlers’ face.\n\nA local farmer told them the dog sounded like one <50>as lost in the local paper. The ad had a <51> number for a town in southern Michigan. Ehlers <52> the number of Jeff and Lisa to tell them he had <53>their dog.\n\nJeff had <54> in Iowa before Thanksgiving with his dog, Rosie, but the gun shots had scared the dog off. Jeff searched <55>for Rosie in the next four days.\n\nEhlers returned to Minnesota, and then drove 100 miles to Minneapolis to put Rosie on a flight to Michigan. \＂It’s good to know there’s still someone out there who <56> enough to go to that kind of <57>,\＂ says Lisa of Ehlers’ rescue <58>.\n\n \＂I figured whoever lost the dog was probably just as <59> to it as I am to my dogs,\＂ says Ehlers. \＂If it had been my dog, I’d hope that somebody would be <60> to go that extra mile.\＂,
