He spent much of his childhood in France where he spent many hours each day outdoors painting pictures. At the age of 18, he moved to the United States. Well, actually. John began his life in the US as a businessman. However, instead of taking care of his business, John was often off exploring nature. At first, John spent his time hunting for fun. Then he found that the animals around were very beautiful, and he particularly enjoyed observing the birds he saw. He began studying them, trying to learn the differences between the birds and noticing their different behaviors.Therefore, he painted the birds he observed a lot. In 1819, John realized that he didn’t have enough money to pay his bills. He was very upset that he couldn’t earn enough money to support his family. So he spent time improving his painting skills and began to sell his paintings. He discovered that he could earn some money while doing something he really enjoyed. We are lucky now to have so many paintings of American birds by John Audubon.\"",
