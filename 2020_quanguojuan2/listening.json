And over that weekend,I wrote the story Clifford the Big Red Dog, and was shocked when it was accepted for publication because I'd never written anything before.\"W: \"I see.

Such exchanges occur at bus stops, on buses, while waiting in line, almost anywhere that strangers gather close together. As a matter of fact, these short conversations are a good way for people to say hello and express friendliness. Such conversations usually cover a wide range of topics. The topics may include weather, customer service, movies, TV shows, local sports or latest news. But you should always keep it in your mind that private questions about salaries, family life, religious beliefs and politics should be avoided during these conversations. Besides, it’s better to ask open-ended questions. If you ask visitors, “Do you like our city?” They may say simply, “Yes”. On the other hand, if you ask, “What do you think of our city?” They will have more freedom in answering. This type of question also shows that you are interested in them. If you appear interested in what people are saying, they’d feel more comfortable talking with you.\"",
