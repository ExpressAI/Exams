The rolling sea of clouds you see once you are at the top will remind you how tiny we <Q57> are.\n\nThe hot spring at the foot of the mountain is something you must try after the climb. It will <Q58> help you get refreshed! The amazing thing about the spring is that the colder the temperature gets, the <Q59> the spring! Strange, isn't it? But that's how nature is—always leaving us <Q60>.\n\nWhat comes next is the endless series of steps. You can't help wondering how hard it <Q61> for the people then to put all those rocks into place.\n\nThough it is the only unnatural thing on your way up the mountain, still it highlights the whole adventure <Q62> offers a place where you can sit down to rest your <Q63> legs.\n\nAs the song goes, this long and winding road \"will never disappear\", and it will always stick in the visitor's memory. It sure does in <Q64>. While you’re in China, Mount Huangshan is <Q65> must to visit!",
