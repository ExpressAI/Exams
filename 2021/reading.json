        "context": "Rome can be pricey for travelers, which is why many choose to stay in a hostel. The hostels in Rome offer a bed in a dorm room for around $25 a night, and for that, you'll often get to stay in a central location with security and comfort.\n\nYellow Hostel\n\nIf I had to make just one recommendation for where to stay in Rome, it would be Yellow Hostel. It's one of the best-rated hostels in the city, and for good reason. It's affordable, and it's got a fun atmosphere without being too noisy. As an added bonus, it's close to the main train station.\n\nHostel Alessandro Palace\n\nIf you love social hostels, this is the best hostel for you in Rome. Hostel Alessandro Palace is fun. Staff members hold plenty of bar events for guests like free shots, bar crawls and karaoke. There's also an area on the rooftop for hanging out with other travelers during the summer.\n\nYouth Station Hostel\n\nIf you're looking for cleanliness and a modern hostel, look no further than Youth Station. It offers beautiful furnishings and beds. There are plenty of other benefits, too; it doesn't charge city tax; it has both air conditioning anda heater for the rooms; it also has free Wi-Fi in every room.\n\nHotel and Hostel DesArtistes\n\nHotel and Hostel Des Artistes is located just a 10-minute walk from the central city station and it's close to all of the city's main attractions. The staff is friendly and helpful, providing you with a map of the city when you arrive, and offering advice if you require some. However, you need to pay 2 euros a day for Wi-Fi.",

        "context": "By day, Robert Titterton is a lawyer. In his spare time though he goes on stage beside pianist Maria Raspopova—not as a musician but as her page turner. \"I'm not a trained musician, but I've learnt to read music so I can help Mariain her performance.\"\n\nMr Titterton is chairman of the Omega Ensemble but has been the group's official page turner for the past four years. His job is to sit beside the pianist and turn the pages of the score so the musician doesn't have to break the flow of sound by doing it themselves. He said he became just as nervous as those playing instruments on stage.\n\n\"A lot of skills are needed for the job. You have to make sure you don't turn two pages at once and make sure you find the repeats in the music when you have to go back to the right spot.\" Mr Titterton explained.\n\nBeing a page turner requires plenty of practice. Some pieces of music can go for 40 minutes and require up to 50 page turns, including back turns for repeat passages. Silent onstage communication is key, and each pianist has their own style of \"nodding\" to indicate a page turn which they need to practise with their page turner.\n\nBut like all performances,there are moments when things go wrong. \"I was turning the page to get ready for the next page, but the draft wind from the turn caused the spare pages to fall off the stand,\" Mr Titterton said, \"Luckily I was able to catch them and put them back.\"\n\nMost page turners are piano students or up-and-coming concert pianists, although Ms Raspopova has once asked her husband to help her out on stage.\n\n\"My husband is the worst page turner,\" she laughed. \"He's interested in the music, feeling every note, and I have to say: 'Turn, turn!' \"Robert is the best page turner I've had in my entire life.\"",

        "context": "When the explorers first set foot upon the continent of North America, the skies and lands were alive with an astonishing variety of wildlife. Native Americans had taken care of these precious natural resources wisely.\n\nUnfortunately, it took the explorers and the settlers who followed only a few decades to decimate a large part of these resources. Millions of waterfowl were killed at the hands of market hunters and a handful of overly ambitious sportsmen. Millions of acres of wetlands were dried to feed and house the ever-increasing populations, greatly reducing waterfowl habitat.\n\nIn1934, with the passage of the Migratory Bird HuntingStamp Act, an increasingly concerned nation took firm action to stop the destruction of migratory waterfowl and the wetlands so vital to their survival. Under this Act, all waterfowl hunters 16 years of age and over must annually purchase and carry a FederalDuck Stamp. The very first Federal Duck Stamp was designed by J.N. \"Ding\" Darling, a political cartoonist from Des Moines, lowa, who at that time was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt as Director of the Bureau of Biological Survey.\n\nHunters willingly pay the stamp price to ensure the survival of our natural resources.\n\nAbout 98 cents of every duck stamp dollar goes directly into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund to purchase wetlands and wildlife habitat for inclusion into the National Wildlife Refuge System — a fact that ensures this land will be protected and available for all generations to come.\n\nSince 1934, better than half a billion dollars has gone into that Fund to purchase more than 5 million acres of habitat. Little wonder the Federal Duck Stamp Program has been called one of the most successful conservation programs ever initiated.",

        "context": "Popularization has in some cases changed the original meaning of emotional intelligence. Many people now misunderstand emotional intelligence as almost everything desirable in a person's makeup that cannot be measured by an IQ test, such as character, motivation, confidence, mental stability, optimism and \"people skills.\" Research has shown that emotional skills may contribute to some of these qualities, but most of them move far beyond skill-based emotional intelligence.\n\nWe prefer to describe emotional intelligence as a specific set of skills that can be used for either good or bad purposes. The ability to accurately understand how others are feeling may be used by a doctor to find how best to help her patients, while a cheater might use it to control potential victims.\n\nBeing emotionally intelligent does not necessarily make one a moral person. Although popular beliefs regarding emotional intelligence run far ahead of what research can reasonably support, the overall effects of the publicity have been more beneficial than harmful.The most positive aspect of this popularization is a new and much needed emphasis on emotion by employers, educators and others interested in promoting social well-being.\n\nThe popularization of emotional intelligence has helped both the public and researchers re-evaluate the functionality of emotions and how they serve people adaptively in everyday life.\n\nAlthough the continuing popular appeal of emotional intelligence is desirable, we hope that such attention will excite a greater interest in the scientific and scholarly study of emotion. It is our hope that in coming decades, advances in science will offer new perspectives from which to study how people manage their lives. Emotional intelligence, with its focus on both head and heart, may serve to point us in the right direction.",

        "context": "My husband and I just spent a week in Paris. <Q36> So the first thing we did was rent a fantastically expensive sixth-floor apartment the size of a cupboard. It was so tiny that we had to leave our suitcases in the hallway.\n\nThe place wasn't entirely authentic, though. Unlike a normal Parisian apartment,the plumbing worked. <Q37> Our building even had a tiny lift with a female voice that said, \"Ouverture des portes,\" in perfect French. That is the only French phrase I mastered, and it's a shame I don't have much use for it.\n\nParisians are different from you and me. They never look lazy or untidy. As someone noted in this paper a couple of weeks ago, they eat great food and never gain weight. <Q38> French strawberries do not taste like cardboard. Instead, they explode in your mouth like little flavor bombs.\n\n<Q39> On our first morning in Paris, I went around the corner to the food market to pick up some groceries. I bought a handful of perfectly ripe small strawberries and a little sweet melon. My husband and I agreed they were the best fruit we had ever eaten. But they cost $18!\n\nIn France, quality of life is much more important than efficiency. You can tell this by cafés life. French cafés are always crowded. <Q40> When do these people work? The French take their 35-hour workweek seriously — so seriously that some labor unions recently struck a deal with a group of companies limiting the number of hours that independent contractors can be on call.",
