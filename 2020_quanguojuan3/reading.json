        "context": "When “Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" was first shown to the public last month, a group of excited animal activists gathered on Hollywood Boulevard. But they weren't there to throw red paint on fur-coat- wearing film stars. Instead, one activist, dressed in a full-body monkey suit, had arrived with a sign praising the filmmakers: \"Thanks for not using real apes (猿)!\"\n\nThe creative team behind\"Apes\" used motion-capture (动作捕捉) technology to create digitalized animals, spending tens of millions of dollars on technology that records an actor's performance and later processes it with computer graphics to create a final image (图像). In this case, one of a realistic-looking ape.\n\nYet \"Apes\" is more exception than the rule. In fact, Hollywood has been hot on live animals lately. One nonprofit organization, which monitors the treatment of animals in filmed entertainment, is keeping tabs on more than 2,000 productions this year,. Already, a number of films, including \"Water for Elephants,\" \"The Hangover Part I\" and \"Zookeeper,\" have drawn the anger of activists who say the creatures acting in them haven't been treated properly.\n\nIn some cases, it's not so much the treatment of the animals on set in the studio that has activists worried; it's the off-set training and living conditions that are raising concerns. And there are questions about the films made outside the States, which sometimes are not monitored as closely as productions filmed in the States.",

        "context": "With the young unable to afford to leave home and the old at risk of isolation (孤独), more families are choosing to live together.\n\nThe doorway to peace and quiet, for Nick Bright at least, leads straight to his mother-in-law: she lives on the ground floor, while he lives upstairs with his wife and their two daughters.\n\nFour years ago they all moved into a three-storey Victorian house in Bristol - one of a growing number of multigenerational families in the UK living together under the same roof. They share a front door and a washing machine, but Rita Whitehead has her own kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living room on the ground floor.\n\n\"We floated the idea to my mum of sharing a house,\" says Kathryn Whitehead. Rita cuts in: \"We spoke more with Nick because I think it's a big thing for Nick to live with his mother-in-law.\"\n\nAnd what does Nick think? \"From my standpoint, it all seems to work very well. Would I recommend it? Yes, I think I would.\"\n\nIt's hard to tell exactly how many people agree with him, but research indicates that the numbers have been rising for some time. Official reports suggest that the number of households with three generations living together had risen from 325,000 in 2001 to 419,000 in 2013.\n\nOther varieties of multigenerational family are more common. Some people live with their elderly parents; many more adult children are returning to the family home, if they ever left. It is said that about 20% of 25-34-year-olds live with their parents, compared with 16% in 1991. The total number of all multigenerational households in Britain is thought to be about 1.8 million.\n\nStories like that are more common in parts of the world, where multigenerational living is more firmly rooted. In India, particularly outside cities, young women are expected to move in with their husband's family when they get married.",

        "context": "We are the products of evolution, and not just evolution that occurred billions of years ago. As scientists look deeper into our genes (基因), they are finding examples of human evolution in just the past few thousand years. People in Ethiopian highlands have adapted to living at high altitudes. Cattle -raising people in East Africa and northern Europe have gained a mutation (突变) that helps them digest milk as adults\n\nOn Thursday in an article published in Cell, a team of researchers reported a new kind of adaptation - not to air or to food, but to the ocean. A group of sea-dwelling people in Southeast Asia have evolved into better divers. The Bajau, as these people are known, number in the hundreds of thousands in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. They have traditionally lived on houseboats; in recent times, they've also built houses on stilts (支柱) in coastal waters. \"They are simply a stranger to the land,\" said Redney C. Jubilado, a University of Hawaii researcher who studies the Bajau.\n\nDr. Jubilado first met the Bajau while growing up on Samal Island in the Philippines. They made a living as divers, spearfishing or harvesting shellfish. \"We were so amazed that they could stay underwater much longer than us local islanders,\" Dr. Jubilado said. \"I could see them actually walking under the sea.\"\n\nIn201, Melissa Ilardo, then a graduate student in genetics at the University of Copenhagen, heard about the Bajau. She wondered if centuries of diving could have led to the evolution of physical characteristics that made the task easier for them. \"it seemed like the perfect chance for natural selection to act on a population,\" said Dr. Ilardo. She also said there were likely a number of other genes that help the Bajau dive.",

Some common things people will put on a gift registry include kitchen tools like knives and things like curtains. Even if there isn't a registry, a good housewarming gift is something to decorate the new house with, like a piece of art or a plant.\n\n<38> This is often appreciated since at a housewarming there isn't a lot of food served. There are usually no planned activities like games at a housewarming party. The host or hostess of the party will, however, probably give all the guests a tour of their new home. Sometimes, because a housewarming party happens shortly after a person moves into their new home, people may be asked to help unpack boxes.<39> \n\nHousewarming parties get their name from the fact that a long time ago people would actually bring firewood to a new home as a gift. <40> Now most homes have central heating and don't use fires to keep warm.",
