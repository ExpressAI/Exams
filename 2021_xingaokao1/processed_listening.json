Language researchers say pronunciation and fluency are the biggest barriers, followed by grammar, in effective spoken English. However, most people don't regard pronunciation as a very important part of communication skills. They're more focused on vocabulary. One reason is that most people are not even aware of their mispronunciations. So it's important to first find out the words you mispronounce. You should listen to experts, by experts, I mean those who are less likely to make pronunciation mistakes. When listening to them, pay attention to words that sound strange, strange because you pronounce the same words differently. When you come across such words, check a dictionary to confirm their exact pronunciations. You can also search for difficult-to-pronounce words and names, and make a list of them. The last suggestion is to read aloud. Now you've got the correct pronunciations of the words, it's time to practice reading them every day.\"",
